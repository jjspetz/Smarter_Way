    <h1>This is my H1 heading.</h1>
    <h2>This is smaller because it is an h2 heading.</h2>
    <p>This is a long multi-line paragraph. I am going to ramble on and on
      because it has to <span class="emphasized red">stretch the whole screen</span>. Alas I have nothing else
     to type but i think this will be good. I was wrong the sentences before this
     did not suffice, however this is good enough.</p>
     <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lories.</p>
     <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
     <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>
     <p> This sentince practices the HTML tags <i>i</i>, <em>em</em>,
       <strong>strong</strong>, and <b>b</b>.</p>
