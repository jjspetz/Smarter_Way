    <h1>This is my H1 heading.</h1>
    <h2>This is smaller because it is an h2 heading.</h2>
    <p>This is a long multi-line paragraph. I am going to ramble on and on
      because it has to <span class="emphasized red">stretch the whole screen</span>. Alas I have nothing else
     to type but i think this will be good. I was wrong the sentences before this
     did not suffice, however this is good enough.</p>
     <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lories.</p>
     <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
     <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>
     <p> This sentence practices the HTML tags <i>i</i>, <em>em</em>,
       <strong>strong</strong>, and <b>b</b>.</p>
     <p class="spaced_out"> This sentence has the class spaced out which puts lots of space between
       its lines, words, and letters.</p>
       <h3>This Heading is Centered!</h3>
       <p class="pretty">This paragraph is justified but i am not sure I have written
         enough to see the full effect. I dislike writing long paragraphs just to get
       them to wrap when i have nothing interesting to type. Here I will just dump
       some song lyrics. So suddenly our Adventure came to an end
       We had been able to go everywhere, just like a free bird
       We thought that time wouldn't mean anything to us
       That we could just throw something as trivial as the world aside</p>
       <blockquote> This is a block quote, despite being very short.</blockquote>
       <p class="offset">This has 5em margins around it!<p>
      <h3 class="borders">This Has a Nice Beautiful Border!</h3>
      <h4>A centered h4 header</h4>
      <p class="center">...and it's centered paragraph<p>
